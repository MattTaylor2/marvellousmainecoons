🐾 Marvellous Maine Coons
A dynamic web platform celebrating Maine Coon cats, designed to support both public engagement and admin-level content management. This project blends playful design with practical functionality, allowing admins to manage users, upload content, and moderate community interaction.

🔐 Admin Login: Secure authentication for site administrators, with the ability to add new users or admins.

🔑 Password Management: Admins can change their own passwords securely.

👥 User Login: External clients can register, log in, and leave comments.

🖼️ Content Management: Admins can drag-and-drop images onto the site and add descriptive text beneath each.

🗣️ Comment Moderation: A dedicated moderation system to review and manage user comments.

🧩 Planned Features

Role-based access control (Admin vs. User)
